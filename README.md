# Simple.css

#### The simple, stupid CSS framework.
***

Simple.css is a bare-boned responsive CSS _"framework"_ made to be customized. No fancy components, no JS plugins, no bloat. Simple.css is not made for the copy-paste web developer, it's for people who like to start with something simple and do the rest by themselves.

#### Project website

Check out Simple.css on its own website, learn what it does and how to use it: [simplecss.algorithm.dk](http://simplecss.algorithm.dk).

You can also just clone this repo and open `index.html` in your browser.
